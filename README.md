Create a MERN stack with user authentication to hold a user's favorite books.

Create the following pages:

- Home: If a user is NOT logged in, show "Not Signed In". If the user IS logged in, show the form to add a new favorite book and below that show all of the user's favorite books.
- Register: Create a new user.
- Log Out: Log out the user.

Make sure to use cookies, and salt/hash your passwords.

1 point. The home page crashes when a user is not logged in. I also don't know if a user is logged in because I don't see a difference in the signin version not signed in.
